# Shopping list project

This is a Python project that implements a simple shopping list application. This project consists of several folders and files, which are described below.

## Project structure

- `conf/`:
    - `log.py`: Manages and sets the project configuration log.
- `core/`:
    - `app.py`: contains the main logic of the application.
- `Shop/`':
    - `utils/`: contains all the functions used in the program.
    - `models/`: contains the models, groupings and products of the product portfolio with their details, as well as the management model to manage, add, edit and delete groups and products.
    - `helper/`: defines constant variables for the project.
- `run.py`: the main file that runs the program.

## How to run the program

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/fsanginnezhad/Shopping-List-Functional.git`.
2. Go to the project directory: "cd Shopping-List-Functional".
3. Run the program: "python run.py".

## Use

The shopping list application allows users to create a new shopping list, add products to it, remove products from it, and display the list of products in the cart. The program also allows the admin user to manage, add, edit and delete groups and products. Users can select and purchase products for their cart by providing the final payable invoice that is provided at the end. Here is a brief overview of the available commands:

- "Add": adds a product to the shopping list.
- "Remove": removes a product from the shopping list.
- "Edit": edited a product from the shopping list.
- "Show": displays the list of products in the shopping cart.
